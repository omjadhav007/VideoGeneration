    "Raj had always been curious about the National Cadet Corps (NCC), but when he joined, he never imagined it would involve guns. The day they arrived at the training camp, he felt both excited and nervous.\n",
    "\"Today, you'll learn to handle a rifle,\" said Lieutenant Mehra as she led the cadets to the shooting range. Raj's heart skipped a beat. He'd never even held a gun before.\n",
    "The instructor handed him a .22 rifle and explained the basic rules: respect the weapon, keep your finger off the trigger until you're ready, and always aim carefully. Raj took a deep breath, placed the rifle against his shoulder, and peered through the sights. His hands were trembling, but he squeezed the trigger. Bang!\n",
    "His shot missed completely. He felt embarrassed but refused to give up.\n",
    "The days passed, and with each practice, Raj's aim improved. He learned the importance of patience and control. The rifle wasn't just about firing; it was about focusing his mind, breathing steady, and staying calm.\n",
    "On the last day of camp, there was a shooting competition. Raj wasn't expecting to win, but he focused on what he'd learnedâ€”discipline, patience, responsibility. One shot. Two shots. Both hit the target.\n",
    "He didn't win the competition, but when Lieutenant Mehra smiled and nodded at him, he knew he had won something far more important: confidence, respect, and the understanding that true strength comes from control, not power.\n",
